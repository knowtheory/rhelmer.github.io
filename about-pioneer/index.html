      <div>
        <p data-l10n-id="pioneer-summary">Pioneer is an experimental 
program that allows you to donate your browsing data to public interest 
scientific studies in areas such as internet misinformation, data 
privacy, and ethical AI.</p>
        <p id="report-details" data-l10n-id="pioneer-details">Participation
 in Pioneer is strictly voluntary. When you enroll in the Pioneer 
program, you will receive periodic offers to join studies led by top 
research teams in collaborations with Mozilla. Your participation in 
each study is voluntary. You can leave an individual study or leave the 
Pioneer program entirely at any time.</p>
      </div>
      <details><summary>What happens next?</summary>
        <p>If you agree to enroll:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>An icon will appear on the Firefox toolbar. The icon 
reminds you that you are a part of Pioneer. You can reach your Pioneer 
settings at any time by clicking this icon.</li>
          <li>We’ll change a Firefox preference, too.  This will tell us
 you are willing to participate in Pioneer studies. Continue using 
Firefox as you normally would. Pioneer will not actually collect any 
data until you decide to join a study.</li>
          <li>Periodically, we will offer you opportunities to join 
studies.  The purpose of these studies will vary, but might focus on 
aspects of Firefox or what you experience on the web.</li>
          <li>Studies will collect different types of information about 
your online behavior, possibly including what web pages you visit and 
how you interact with them. Each study will have a privacy notice and 
information for you explainingabout the data being collected, who will 
have access to use it, and the study’s purpose.</li>
          <li>Periodically, we may ask you a yes/no question about what 
you are currently doing with the browser. As with all of Pioneer, 
choosing to answer these questions will be entirely optional.</li>
        </ol>
      </details>
      <details><summary>Leaving Pioneer</summary>
        <p>You are welcome to leave any individual study or the Firefox Pioneer program entirely at any time.</p>
        To leave the Firefox Pioneer program entirely:
        <ol>
          <li>Return to this page by clicking the Pioneer toolbar icon 
in Firefox or typing about:pioneer into the location bar and pressing 
Enter.</li>
          <li>Click the “Leave Pioneer” button above.</li>
          <li>Opting out of Firefox Pioneer will immediately unenroll 
you from any in-progress studies that you had already joined. When you 
leave Pioneer, you will no longer receive offers to join new studies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To leave individual studies:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Return to this page by clicking the Pioneer toolbar icon 
in Firefox or typing about:pioneer into the location bar and pressing 
Enter.</li>
          <li>All the studies that you have joined will be listed. To leave a specific study, click on the Leave button next to the study.</li>
          <li>Leaving a study will immediately stop collection of data 
associated with that study and remove any changes made to the browser as
 part of the study.</li>
        </ol>
        Leaving an individual study will not affect opportunities to join future studies.
      </details>
      <details><summary>Your Privacy</summary>
        <p>Mozilla is sensitive to the nature of the data it may collect
 in some Pioneer studies. We always work hard to keep your data private 
and secure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We will not attempt to collect cookies, account names, 
passwords, email addresses, or the data you submit in web forms (POST 
form values).</li>
          <li>The data you submit is encrypted in Firefox and not 
decrypted until it is on a server that is not connected to the wider 
internet.</li>
          <li>This data will be linked to a randomly generated ID we 
only use for Pioneer. It is used to keep a specific user's data together
 on the server and helps us improve our analysis.  It does not allow us 
to identify a specific study participant.</li>
          <li>No data will be collected from inside Private Browsing windows.</li>
          <li>Proposed studies will be reviewed by a panel consisting of
 privacy experts, internet researchers and web security engineers to 
ensure that the data being collected is appropriate and respects 
participant privacy.</li>
          <li>Individual level raw data will never be shared publicly or sold.</li>
          <li>Only a small number of researchers will have access to a 
study’s raw data. If we share aggregate information from studies, we 
will disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of participants being 
identified.</li>
        </ul>
